# Slot- This is a siimple slot machine program made in Python. At the point of making this, I had been writing code for a little over a month. The game is simplistic and does have issues. 

The main problem comes when betting on lines. Ideally you could choose what line to bet on ( you would be betting on whatever line you choose to return the same symbols ) 

In this program, if you bet on one line, you are betting on the first line...If youre betting on two lines youre betting on lines 1 and 2...etc.

Other than that, this was a fun project to study up on some fundamentals.
